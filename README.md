# Stroke Risk Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an R script focused on analyzing and predicting stroke risk using advanced data preprocessing techniques and machine learning models. The project showcases expertise in handling and interpreting health-related data, applying statistical modeling, and deploying predictive analytics to assess stroke risk.

## Data Preprocessing

#### The script meticulously prepares the stroke dataset for analysis through several crucial preprocessing steps:

Data Cleaning: Implements strategies for handling missing values to maintain the dataset's quality and reliability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts a thorough examination of the dataset to identify distributions, outliers, and patterns among the key variables influencing stroke risk.
Feature Engineering: Enhances model accuracy by transforming and selecting significant variables, either by creating new features from existing ones or adjusting current features to capture essential risk factors more effectively.
Data Splitting: Segregates the dataset into training and testing subsets, enabling a robust assessment of the predictive models' performance.
Models for Predicting Stroke Risk

#### The project employs two principal models to ascertain stroke risk, leveraging their distinct strengths:

Decision Tree: Utilizes the decision tree model from the tree library, providing a straightforward and interpretable framework that delineates the primary predictors of stroke risk.
Random Forest: Applies the randomForest library to construct an ensemble model that aggregates multiple decision trees to boost prediction accuracy. This model addresses overfitting concerns and enhances the ability to generalize findings to new data.
